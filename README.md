# Project background
A project to clone the twitter home page (before Twitter became X!) using Next JS (because I wanted to try this framework) and Tailwind (to hone my tailwind skills!)

# Repo start up
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
